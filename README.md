# arduinoRC
RC Car using an Arduino and PPM/PWM based RC Controller. This is the first part of my project. As I build more and get more components to run, I'll add additional code and explainations where I can.

## Requirements
I'm using the Adafruit Motorshield v2.3 for Arduino. Make sure you download and install the correct libraries so the code will work.

[Adafruit MotorShield v2.3](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-motor-shield-v2-for-arduino/install-software)  
[EnableInterrupt](https://github.com/GreyGnome/EnableInterrupt)

I also used this document to source some of the code. It's extensible enough to add or remove RC channels as needed. It's also a good read to understand what you need to do.

## Equipment
I'm using 4 dc motors attached to an acrylic chassis, and controlling all four motors at the same time using the Arduino. Power is provided by a 8x 1.5v Alkaline pack (will be updating this to actual RC batteries). 

More information to come as I continue building this project. If you would like to help out, refactor, or make my life easier, feel free to submit changes and I'll review them.
